# Competitive Programming Resources

This directory contains helpful resources for competitive programming to improve your problem-solving skills.

## Contents

- [ASCII Table][def1]
- [C++ STL Reference Manual][def2]
- [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook (Antti Laaksonen)][def3]
- [Competitive Programming - The new Lower Bound of Programming Contests (Steven Halim and Felix Halim)][def4]
- [Guide to Competitive Programming - Learning and Improving Algorithms Through Contests (Antti Laaksonen)][def5]
- [Operator Precedence][def6]
- [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Programming Contests (Nite Nimajneb)][def7]

## Purpose

These resources are meant to serve as references while solving problems from various competitive programming platforms like [CodeForces][def8], [CodeChef][def9], [AtCoder][def10],[SPOJ][def11], [CSES][def12].

## How to Use

1. Browse through the available resources
2. Understand the implementations and techniques
3. Adapt them to solve specific problems
4. Practice regularly to improve your skills

## Contributing

Feel free to add more resources that you find helpful! Please follow the [contribution guidelines][def13] of the main repository when adding new content.

## Recommended Learning Path

1. Master basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
2. Learn fundamental algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
3. Study advanced data structures (trees, graphs, heaps)
4. Practice dynamic programming problems
5. Explore specialized topics (number theory, combinatorics)

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
